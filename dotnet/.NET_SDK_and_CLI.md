# How to use .NET SDK and CLI

A summary on the description and uses of .NET SDK and CLI.

## .NET SDK

The .NET SDK, aka, .NET Software Development Kit, is a set of libraries and tools which came as part of .NET Core release. It allows developers to create .NET applications and libraries. It consists of the following components:

- .NET CLI
- .NET libraries and runtime
- .NET driver

### .NET Runtime and SDK

- #### .NET SDK

  - .NET SDK provides CLI and compiler. These features enable the user to develop .NET Core applications.
  - It can be used to develop as well as run .NET Core applications.

- #### .NET Runtime

  - .NET Runtime provides a virtual machines that hosts or runs the application while providing an abstraction from the operating system.
  - It is required to run applications. It cannot be used to develop applications.

### .NET Core SDK download and install

It is recommended to install the latest version of .NET Core SDK. The steps involved are as follows:

1. Navigate to this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet.

2. Select the appropriate version required, latest is recommended.

3. Download installer for required OS type and install SDK.

4. Restart system for system environment variables to get updated.

5. Open command line; run the following command and verify whether appropriate version was installed:

   ```shell
   dotnet --version
   ```



## .NET CLI

.NET Core Command Line Interface or .NET CLI is a tool used for development and other operations such as building, running and publishing of .NET applications.

- .NET CLI is installed while installing .NET SDK.

- Visual Studio IDE uses .NET CLI internally for restoring, building, publishing and running applications.

- The command structure of .NET CLI is as follows:

  ```shell
  dotnet <command> <argument> <option>
  ```

- `dotnet` acts as the driver in the above command and is responsible for starting the execution of the specified command.

- To verify whether .NET CLI is installed

  - Open command prompt.
  - Type `dotnet` and press enter.
  - Usage details indicate successful installation.
